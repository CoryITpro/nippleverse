They belong to all of us yet we are ashamed of them because society taught us so. However, their power is too much to contain, they found refuge on the Ethereum blockchain, and now they are ready to break free. With about 8,000,000,000 people in the world and only 4444 unique entities, only a few will be able to claim they were brave enough to #freethenipple and wear them as badges of honor."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
